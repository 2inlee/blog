Thank you for visit my Blog

First Post in my blog

`posts` is are posted whenever I want

The post is for the record, but I'll leave an additional explanation for someone who's worried about the same problem

Every post is meant to be a scrap

Regardless of whether it is non-profit or profitable, anyone is actively encouraged to scrap unauthorized copying of the article.



```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("hello world !");
  return 0;
}
```

```python
word = 'hello world'
print(word)
```
